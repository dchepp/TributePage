        <li><strong>Universal Basic Income:</strong> Yang's signature policy is a $1,000 per month "Freedom Dividend" to all U.S. citizens over the age of 18, which is a form of Universal Basic Income, as a response to ongoing job displacement through automation.</li>
         <li><strong>Gun Conrol: </strong>Yang's campaign website contains a detailed explanation of his gun control plan. He supports the creation of a stringent, three-tiered licensing system for gun ownership, the restriction of the ability of people with a history of violence, domestic abuse, or violent mental illness to acquire firearms, and the grandfathering of current gun owners and the offering of a one-time "Good Gun Owner" tax credit. on climate engineering. </li>
        <li><strong>Drug Policy: </strong>Yang supports the legalization of cannabis and the decriminalization of opioids (including heroin) for personal use, but he does not support legalizing or decriminalizing cocaine.
               <li><strong>Health Care: </strong>In addition to Universal Basic Income, support for single-payer healthcare is a fundamental aspect of Yang's platform. Yang believes that such an approach will make holistic and preventive care more feasible. </li>
               <li><strong>Immigration: </strong>Yang is a supporter of the DREAM Act, a bill that would protect migrants who entered the United States illegally as minors. He would create a new category of residency that would allow certain undocumented migrants to gain citizenship after 18 years in the country. </li>
               <li><strong>Climate Change: </strong>Yang supports the legalization of cannabis and the decriminalization of opioids (including heroin) for personal use, but he does not support legalizing or decriminalizing cocaine. </li>
